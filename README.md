### Hi there 👋

![github banner](https://github.com/priya-km/priya-km/assets/118628757/ef981ec1-f433-4499-86d0-3d3ce9b0a716)

My name is Priya (pree-yah) and I'm a full stack web developer currently based in New York City. I mainly enjoy front end development and love to keep learning new languages.<br>

I've completed several successful apps using both front end and back end technologies such as: 
- Basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Front-End: Angular, React, React Native, npm, and more.
- Back-End: Python, Django, MongoDB, Firebase, Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Heroku, and more.

<h3>I am currently open to remote, hybrid, and on site (in the NYC area) work. Let's chat! </h3>

## Current Projects:
- 🛒 I’m currently working on an e-commerce app called E-Shop that is being developed with the MERN stack
- 💼 I am also working on the completion of case studies for all of my current projects
- 🗨️ I will soon start working on my 'Chat App' project once more, improving its UI and more.

## About Me:
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects together!
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid Pokemon fan!
