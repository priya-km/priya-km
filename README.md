### Hi there 👋

My name is Priya (pree-yah) and I'm a UI and UX designer with a web development background, currently based in New York City. I enjoy user research and embrace accessible user centered interface design.<br>

<h3>I am currently open to remote, hybrid, and on site (in the NYC area) work within the user experience and user interface (UI/UX) field. Let's chat! </h3>

## Current Projects:
- 💼 I am currently working on a student project of the design of an augmented reality zoo app! You can view it on my UI/UX portfolio soon.
- 📝 I have moved my portfolio over to a new site (listed below), it currently showcases the projects I have worked on in my UI/UX bootcamp and I will soon move over the old case studies of my web development projects as well.

## About Me:
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid Pokemon fan!
