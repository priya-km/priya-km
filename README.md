My name is Priya and I'm a full stack web developer currently based in New York City. I mainly enjoy front end development and love to keep learning new languages.<br>

I've completed several successful apps using both front end and back end technologies such as: 
- Basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Front-End: Angular, React, React Native, npm, and more.
- Back-End: Python (learning), MongoDB, Firebase, Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and more.

<h3>I am currently open to remote, hybrid, and on site (in the NYC area) work. Let's chat! </h3>
