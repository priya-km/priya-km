### Hi there 👋

![github banner](https://github.com/priya-km/priya-km/assets/118628757/ef981ec1-f433-4499-86d0-3d3ce9b0a716)

My name is Priya (pree-yah) and I'm a full stack web developer currently based in New York City. I mainly enjoy front end development and love to keep learning new languages.<br>

I've completed several successful apps using both front end and back end technologies such as: 
- Basics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Front-End: Angular, React, React Native, npm, and more.
- Back-End: Python, Django, MongoDB, Firebase, Express, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Heroku, and more.

<h3>I am currently open to remote, hybrid, and on site (in the NYC area) work within the user experience and user interface (UI/UX) field. Let's chat! </h3>

## Current Projects:
- 💻 I'm currently branching out into studying ui/ux design! 
- 💼 I am currently working on a student project of the design of an augmented reality zoo app! You can view it on my UI/UX portfolio soon.
- 📝 I have moved my portfolio over to a new site (listed below), it currently showcases the projects I have worked on in my UI/UX bootcamp and I will soon move over the old case studies of my web development projects as well.

## About Me:
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an avid Pokemon fan!
